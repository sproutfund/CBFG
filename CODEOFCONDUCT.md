# Participation Guidelines

This project respects Mozilla's [community participation guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). These guidelines cover our behaviour as participants, facilitators, space wranglers, staff, volunteers, vendors, and anyone else involved in making the MozFest and the Mozilla Open Leaders Cohort possible.

## How to treat each other

* Be respectful and welcoming
* Try to understand different perspectives
* Do not threaten violence
* Empower others
* Strive for excellence
* Don’t expect to agree with every decision

## Inclusion and Diversity

The Community Building Field Guide welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.

We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views.

Mozilla-based activities like this project should be inclusive and should support such diversity.

## Working in the Open

Because working open is one of our core values, content development for the Community Building Field Guide (CBFG) is done in the open on Github (check out our repo [here](https://github.com/sproutfund/CBFG)). We hope participants will benefit from this culture of transparency and collaboration during MozFest and throughout the development of this project, and will continue to work with an open ethos in their projects after Mozfest.
