# Contributing to the Community Building Field Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to The Sprout Fund‚Äôs Community Building Field Guide! :tada: 

The [Community Building Field Guide (CBFG)](README.md) is an effort to develop an open source resource that documents Sprout‚Äôs community building philosophy. We‚Äôre creating a collection of stories about community builders ‚Äî the activists and advocates who use open practices to catalyze civic action.

This document is a set of guidelines for contributing to Sprout‚Äôs Community Building Field Guide on GitHub. These are guidelines, not rules. This guide is meant to make it easy for you to get involved.

## Participation guidelines

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODEOFCONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to connect@sproutfund.org.

## What we're working on

The Field Guide will feature ‚Äúdispatches from the field,‚Äù and we need your help to connect with community builders working in various contexts around the world. 

‚≠êÔ∏è  [**Use this form to nominate yourself or others to be featured in the Field Guide**.](http://sproutfund.org/dispatch) ‚≠êÔ∏è  We‚Äôll follow up with about 20 people to conduct in-depth interviews about their work, including the philosophy, tools, and methods they use to build effective communities. 

## What we‚Äôll do next

We‚Äôre proud to be part of the Mozilla Open Leaders Cohort 4 (go Rebel Foxes! ü¶ä ). We‚Äôll spend the final months of 2017 further developing the Field Guide and creating more ways for community builders around the world to contribute to this work. 

In October, we‚Äôre focusing on gathering ‚Äúdispatches from the field.‚Äù In November and December, we expect to invite people to contribute to additional sections of the Field Guide, including: 
* Protips (contribute other ideas for leading stellar events)
* Methods (contribute to the methods library) 
* Glossary and knowledge bank (contribute definitions for keywords and relevant links)

You can view our [project roadmap](ROADMAP.md) to see what we‚Äôll be up to next. Check back in November for more ways to get contribute to this work!
