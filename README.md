# Community Building Field Guide

The Community Building Field Guide (CBFG) is an effort to develop an open source resource that documents Sprout’s community building philosophy and showcases “dispatches from the field.” 

## About Sprout
**The Sprout Fund is a leader in catalytic funding, network stewardship, and the art of facilitation.** Sprout helps foundations, nonprofits, companies, and governments make an impact on the issues they care about most. Over the last 16 years, we've designed dozens of philanthropic programs and invested more than $7 million in more than 1,000 people, projects, and ideas. 

At Sprout, we believe that adopting a structured framework for collaboration can help people develop novel, high-impact solutions to their communities’ challenges. We believe that the best chance to equitably spread the adoption of innovative practices is through the distribution of practical, actionable knowledge through well-managed networks. For more than 6 years, we have helped organizations in Pittsburgh and across the United States develop effective, network-based solutions to their communities’ challenges. 

**This fall, The Sprout Fund is developing a Community Building Field Guide (CBFG) to codify and share what we’ve learned with practitioners around the world.** We’re inviting people from our home in Pittsburgh and from further afield to share their insights on the best ways to mobilize people to make an impact on the issues they care about most. 

## Getting Started

In addition to content developed by Sprout staff, the CBFG will feature profiles that highlight the work of community builders in various contexts. These “dispatches from the field” will highlight the purpose, methods, and achievements of each community builder’s efforts, along with preferred methods, protips, and further insights.

We’re using MozFest to launch our call for contributions from community builders from around the world. In the weeks ahead, we’ll offer more opportunities for people to contribute to the development of the Field Guide’s glossary and knowledge bank.
